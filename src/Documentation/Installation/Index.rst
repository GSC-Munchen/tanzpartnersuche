Installation
============

As the extension is currently not listed within TYPO3 Repository, please download the latest release from GIT repository at 
`GIT GSC-Munchen <https://github.com/GSC-Munchen/tanzpartnersuche/releases/>`__ (GitHub).

For the moment you have to extract the downloaded file. The source code for the extention can be found in the 'src/' directory. 
You can zip the whole content of this directory again and log in to your TYPO3 backend. Menu 'Extension' allows you to manually 
upload files to the backend. By doing so, extension will be installed manually and is activated.

As the extension comes out of the box fully featured with user management to register, verify, edit and delete users and their 
profiles, as well with all functionality to search within profiles and send mails, there are no dependencies. The extension
can be used on its own.

Don't forget to add the static template provided with the extension in your TYPO3 configuration.

Open the page where you want to add the extension in your TYPO3 installation. Add a new plugin and select 
'tanzpartnersuche [tanzpartnersuche_tanzpartnersuche]'. Save and you are done. The extension comes with a CSS file and is ready
to use.
