For Editors
===========

As described in the section 'Installation', please simply ask your admin to install the extension. 
At the current implementation stage, there are no more possibilities like e.g. a backend module to enter, edit or delete profiles or 
change configurations or CSS styling. This is work in progress.

Users can maintain their profiles completely on their own. A 'forgotten password' functionality is implemented. So users can help
themselves in self-service. All passwords are encrypted and salted. An editor as well as an admin is not able to read or reset them.
